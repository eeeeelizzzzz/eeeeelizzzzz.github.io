Instead of placing focus and value on punitive, demerit-based metrics that are not necessarily well applied to all students or all scenarios, we took a step back to reexamine our approach to ‚Äòassessment‚Äô and tailor it toward the experiences, learning opportunities and outcomes, and the skills development we hope to cultivate during our time together.</p> <p>The way grades are applied in this course will likely be different than many courses you have taken in the past. However, for this grading approach to be successful, we need students to buy in. The approach relies on honest reflections from students on their learning goals and their own progress throughout the course. On this page, we will document the ‚Äògrading‚Äô approach we are applying in this course. With feedback and collaboration from the students in the class, this approach is subject to change throughout the semester. It will not change without notice, and any and all changes will be documented here. Below the documentation, we offer some more discussion of the why and additional resources for the curious among us.</p> <p><strong><em>Approach</em></strong> The approach we have opted to use is not perfectly described as ‚Äòungrading,‚Äô but it falls under that general umbrella. Some other approaches that we borrowed from are ‚Äòcontract grading‚Äô and ‚Äòspecification grading,‚Äô but like ‚Äòungrading‚Äô they are not a perfect fit for our work together. As we went through the review and development process for this class, we found that our scientific research class which includes coding and data assignments alongside longer form project writing tasks made elements from each of these approaches both useful and difficult to apply. The result we landed with is closest to ‚Äòspecification grading‚Äô with elements from other types of non-standard grading approaches.</p> <p>In the end, our motivation is to focus on getting the learning and the doing, not to focus on getting the exact ‚Äòright‚Äô answer every time. We aim for this approach to reduce pressure to achieve possibly arbitrary measures of success and instead allow space for taking risk, trying things, and learning in the process.</p> <p><strong><em>Single-Point Rubrics</em></strong> The single point rubric is a main feature of this approach. All evaluated assignments are ‚Äògraded‚Äô against a rubric that defines the ‚Äòsatisfactory‚Äô or ‚Äòmeets expectations‚Äô level of success for the work. This level of success and the criteria required to achieve it describe the criteria for proficiency. No more. No less. This [website] (https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/holistic-analytic-single-point-rubrics/) offers a good example based on rubrics for scoring breakfast in bed. The rubrics you may be more used to seeing are called ‚Äòanalytic rubrics‚Äô and are compared in the linked example.</p> <p><strong><em>Outcomes</em></strong> Throughout the semester, rubrics for different tasks or assignments will be connected to the course‚Äôs learning outcomes. There are numerical values connected to the level of ‚Äòachievement‚Äô within these outcomes. This is the first time we are using this cross-cutting outcome connection approach, so consider it ‚Äúin beta‚Äù. These are not directly related to your ‚Äògrade‚Äô or how well you are doing in the class. These are intended to help show how different components of the work we do connect to the overall course outcome and help identify any patterns for areas where you may excel or may face more friction. These patterns are helpful for you to know where to invest time and attention and helpful for us to know what we are or are not succeeding to cover or convey in our course material.</p> <p><strong><em>Assessment</em></strong> The coursework is distributed between homework assignments and the semester-long group project. The project provides an opportunity for students to apply much of the what they are learning in near-real time in a collaborative setting, while the homework assignments are individual assignments establishing the skills and knowledge base we aim to develop. As such, the final outcome of student success is weighted a bit more by their efforts on the homework assignments.</p> <p><strong><em>Homeworks</em></strong> There are four homework assignments spaced throughout the semester. In general, each assignment provides about two weeks to complete with one in-class help session offered within that window. This course is adopting a Token Framework for homework.</p> <p>All students will have two tokens to apply to a homework assignments during the semester. The tokens allow the student a ‚Äòre-do‚Äô on a homework assignment. A token must be exercised in time for the newly completed version of a homework assignment is complete and submitted by the submission deadline of the next homework (or other agreed on date in the case of HW 4). This token framework enables students that perform below their own expectations an opportunity to more effectively learn material from what a traditional grading scheme would otherwise deem a ‚Äòfailure‚Äô and earn a positive outcome. Note that repeat homework assignments will be based on the same set of questions or tasks, but may require using a different dataset.</p> <p>All completed and final homework assignments are assessed with single point rubrics and included together in a cumulative assessment of a Course ‚Äògrade‚Äô according to the criteria listed in the table included in the section below.</p> <p><strong>Project</strong> The project will be graded based on cumulative assessment of all project components. Each component will have a single-point rubric assigned to it. Group collaboration evaluations will be updated alongside each project component, however the final evaluation of group collaboration will address collaboration throughout the entire project. We reserve the right to evaluate different members of the groups differently based on their contributions. Except in the event of non-submission, proposals will not be evaluated below expectations. At the proposal stage, groups may be flagged for ‚Äòbelow expectations‚Äô status on group collaboration. This outcome requires students to closely evaluate their groups and take action to address the collaboration. Actions can include support from instructors to achieve collaborative group structures. In extreme cases where collaboration is not achievable through actions by group members, steps can be taken toward separating evaluation of group members performing ‚Äòbelow expectations‚Äô from the overall group assessment.</p> <p><strong><em>Reflections and Feedback</em></strong> Throughout the duration of the course, students will be asked to reflect on their progress, goals, and outcomes honestly. This will also serve as a check-in for feedback on the single-point rubric-based evaluations provided in the course and any corrections or adjustments needed on the part of the student or instructor in that process. Guidance will be provided for this exercise ahead of time. Some instances will likely happen asynchronously while others will likely be scheduled for in-person meetings. These are subject to adjustment. Students are also always welcome and encouraged to use office hours/appointments to engage in reflections and feedback. We have also added an anonymous survey where students can share any anxiety or concern you have about the class and grading approach. The preferred route for sharing these is through email and or meetings with instructors, but recognizing that barrier can be high the anonymous survey can be an alternative option.</p> <p><strong><em>Course Grade</em></strong> The overall grade in the course combines the assessment of all homework assignments with the final assessment of the project.</p> <p><strong><em>Tokens</em></strong> All students have two ‚Äòtokens‚Äô which can be used to repeat any homework assignment that does not meet their own evaluation goals. Tokens must be exercised such that a repeated homework can be completed by the submission date of the next homework (or other agreed upon date in the case of HW4). Repeat homework assignments will be based on the same set of questions or tasks, but may require using a different dataset.</p> <p><strong><em>Resources and Background</em></strong> ‚ÄúResearch shows three reliable effects when students are graded: They tend to think less deeply, avoid taking risks, and lose interest in learning itself.‚Äù - <a href="https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/trouble-rubrics/?ref=jessestommel.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alfie Kohn, ‚ÄúThe Trouble with Rubrics‚Äù</a></p> <p><em>A general primer</em> Jesse Stommel writes, speaks, and produces a variety of content on ‚Äòungrading,‚Äô which you can access online.

Schools use grades to force students to meet certain ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù. Grades are a tool of control ‚Äì even if good intentioned.</p> <p>Removing grades allows students to explore and find what is truly meaningful to them. Instead of setting fixed learning objectives and measuring all students the same way, each student can set their own goals and classroom efforts can instead focus on supporting their progress. By emphasizing supportive feedback over grades, educators can demonstrate care for their individual learning and help them engage with what matters to them. When feedback is given with a grade, students often see it as just justifying that grade. Without grades, feedback can be appreciated for its own sake and used constructively. Eliminating grades shifts the focus to the value of students‚Äô work and the feedback to improve it.</p> <p>‚ÄúPunitive grading‚Äù penalizes students for making mistakes rather than using those mistakes as opportunities for growth and encourages students to avoid errors instead of learning from them. Although we might advise students to learn from their mistakes and provide feedback to help with this, grades often tell a different story. They penalize mistakes, causing students to feel regret and focus on past errors. In high-performing groups, an ‚ÄúA‚Äù might be the only grade that avoids negative feelings; anything less is viewed as failure. This creates a dangerous perfectionism that can harm all learners, whether they are struggling or performing well. Maybe especially those that are performing well. Taking it a step further, grading encourages students to adopt problematic habits such as focusing only on achieving high grades and doing the minimum required to get an A, rather than seeking deeper understanding. ‚ÄúIs this going to be on the test?‚Äù These habits can lead to extremes and uncharacteristic behaviors like a student being motivated to cheat, the dishonest behavior could be a lesser evil compared to receiving a poor grade. Removing grades eliminates this pressure, reducing the motivation for such rationalizations and increasing the space for actual learning and engagement. Experiencing hyper focus on avoiding failure and seeing anxious perfectionism play out in previous course offering motivated our shift in grading approach, specifically toward a proficiency-based specifications approach.</p> <p>In all, learning isn‚Äôt about never making mistakes but about understanding and addressing them. Grades don‚Äôt distinguish between issues like a lack of skills or insufficient rest, while feedback supports improvement through revision. Traditional grading often undermines the value of revision, presenting it as punishment for poor performance rather than a valuable learning tool. Without grades, revision can become a normal part of the learning process, focused on continual improvement rather than rewards or penalties. This motivates the TOKEN FRAMEWORK we apply in this class.</p> <p>Additional Resources As compiled by Jesse Stommel <a href="http://bit.ly/ungrading" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.jessestommel.com/grades-are-dehumanizing-ungrading-is-no-simple-solution/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">‚ÄúGrades are Dehumanizing; Upgrading is No Simple Solution.‚Äù</a> by Jesse Stommel</p> <p><a href="https://www.jessestommel.com/ungrading-a-bibliography/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">‚ÄúWhat if We Didn‚Äôt Grade?
