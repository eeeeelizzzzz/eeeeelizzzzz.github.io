# METR4603/5603: Advanced Observations for Lower Atmospheric Research
**University of Oklahoma, School of Meteorology**
Offered: 
 - Fall 2021
 - [Fall 2024: ungrading approach implemented](/metr5603/)
The course is intended to be offered every other fall semester. 

### Course Prerequisites

* **METR4603:** METR2213, METR2613, or instructor permission.
* **METR5603:** METR5004 (concurrent enrollment accepted) or instructor permission.

### Course Description
Building upon foundational lessons from METR2613 (or similar), this course examines the observation and operation principles behind various **research-grade instruments**. Students learn to analyze the data they provide through a mix of group instruction, guest lectures, instrument demonstrations, and **data-focused projects**. The focus is on modern, state-of-the-art instruments applied to current research problems, emphasizing lower-atmospheric observations. Students will use **Python** for processing, analysis, and visualization of real observed datasets. üêç

### Course Goals & Outcomes
**Goals:**
Students will become familiar with several research-grade observation platforms and gain experience synthesizing observations to address research problems. They will also gain transferable skills in interrogating and quality-assuring observed datasets, preparing them for research or data analysis careers using modern meteorological observations.

**Outcomes:**
Upon completion, students will be able to:
- Describe the benefits and limitations of various observation platforms.
- Interpret, quality-assure, and extract relevant information from observed data.
- Develop and modify code (Python) to visualize observed data.
- Analyze and interpret data to provide insight on atmospheric processes.
- Write a journal-article-style research paper outlining a research question, methods, and results.

# Teaching Assistant 2015‚Äì2018
During graduate study, Elizabeth instructed and helped develop the lab portion of Meteorological Measurement Systems, a junior-level, writing-intensive course. She taught observation techniques from calibration to characterization, developed new material to enhance scientific writing instruction, modernized lab experiments, and created Python coding assignments. She also offered coding/writing help sessions and guest lectured for the lecture component.
