Dr. Elizabeth Smith has been a research meteorologist at NOAA’s [National Severe Storms Laboratory](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/) since January 2020. Her scientific work at NSSL focuses broadly on boundary layer processes relevant to near- and pre-storm environments and convection initiation an how to observe them. She specializes in boundary-layer observations, including remote profiling and uncrewed aircraft.  She earned a Ph.D. in Meteorology from the University of Oklahoma in December of 2018 and spent a postdoctoral year at OU’s NOAA Cooperative Institute. Before graduate study at OU, she earned a B.S. in Meteorology at the California University of Pennsylvania—now called [PennWest California](https://www.pennwest.edu/)—in 2014. Beyond her specialty-specific contributions, Dr. Smith is invested in making science tangible, applicable, and approachable for everybody.
